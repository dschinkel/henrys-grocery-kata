# Java Exercise

This is a simple exercise to allow you to demostrate your software engineering skillset. It's completly up to you how long you give yourself, stop when you're happy with the quality of your work, but we don't expect it to take too long.

## Instructions
  1. Commit changes frequently so that we can review your progression with you later.

  2. You should use a recognised build tool, e.g. _gradle_, _maven_...
  3. Use the JDK you think is most appropriate to demonstrate your skillset, but nothing older than 1.8 please. 
  4. We don't expect 100% code coverage, we expect well tested code.
